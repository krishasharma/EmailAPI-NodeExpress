# Email API - Node.js & Express

This is my submission for CSE186 Summer 2024 Assignment 5. In this project, I developed a RESTful E-Mail API using Node.js and Express, along with tests to ensure the API works as expected. This assignment helped me reinforce concepts related to REST APIs, OpenAPI specifications, and server-side development.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to build a RESTful API that manages emails across different mailboxes. I implemented several endpoints to perform basic CRUD operations, such as fetching emails, creating new emails, and moving emails between mailboxes. The project follows the OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification for defining API behavior and validation.
